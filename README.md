Library REST API Project
The purpose of this exercise is to create the server-side portion of a system in charge of managing a libraryâ€™s catalog of books. The system also needs to be able to track library members and which books they currently have checked out. Since this is only the server-side portion of the application, you'll need to provide a REST API for the client to use.
